# Task Management System

Welcome to the Task Management System! This is an easy-to-use web application that helps individuals and teams organize their work by managing tasks efficiently. You can create tasks, assign them to people, update their progress, and keep track of everything—all in one place.

The system ensures everyone has the right access based on their role, so admins, managers, and regular users see only what they need to. It’s built using PHP and MySQL with a solid structure to keep everything organized and working smoothly behind the scenes.
## Features
- Different user roles with specific access rights (admins, managers, users)
- Secure login to protect your information
- Create, assign, update, and track tasks easily
- Clear organization of the system to keep tasks and users managed properly

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** (the “engine” behind the app): PHP
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** MySQL
- Organized using MVC architecture — meaning the system is built in separate parts to keep things neat and easy to maintain

## Setup
1. Download or clone the project files to your computer.
2. Import the included database into your MySQL server.
3. Update the configuration file to connect the system to your database.
4. Run the application on a PHP-enabled server (like XAMPP or WAMP).
